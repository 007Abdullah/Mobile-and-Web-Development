    <h1>This is the main heading </h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
        the page. And if the page is a long one it might
        be split up into several sub-headings.
    </p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-heading </h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
        you follow the structure of what is being written.
        There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
        headings).
    </p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>paragraph consists of one or more sentences
        that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
        start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
        line.
    </p>
    <p>Text is easier<br /> to understand when it is split up
        into units of text. For example, a book may have
        chapters.<br /> Chapters can have subheadings. Under
        each heading there will be one or more
        paragraphs.
